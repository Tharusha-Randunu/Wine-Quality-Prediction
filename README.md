# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Machine Learning Assignment  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **wine quality** (red or white) based on various physicochemical properties using **machine learning** techniques. The dataset contains attributes like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more. The objective is to build a classification model that accurately differentiates between high and low-quality wines.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing and understanding dataset trends  
- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling  
- 🏗 **Feature Engineering** – Selecting the most relevant attributes for prediction  
- 🤖 **Model Training & Evaluation** – Using multiple ML algorithms to compare performance  
- 🎯 **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimizing models for better accuracy  
- 📈 **Performance Metrics** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score comparison  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Google Colab** – Running Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used:  
- **winequality-red.csv** (Red wine data)  
- **winequality-white.csv** (White wine data)
